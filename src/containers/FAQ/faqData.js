When a survivor does this, the original attack is paused, the surge attack is completely resolved, then the original attack picks up exactly where it left off, regardless of the new positions of the survivors or monsters.<br><br>\n\nEXAMPLE: Lucy hits a White Lion, but fails to wound. The Hit Location she drew had a Failure reaction to perform Basic Action, targeting the attacker. Before the White Lion performs this reaction, Zachary surges and attacks the monster. His first wound attempt triggers a reaction, causing the lion to dart forward and grab Zachary with it. Zachary is knocked down, so his attack ends. Then, unless another survivor surges, the showdown returns to Lucy's original attack and the White Lion performs its Basic Action. Assuming Lucy is still standing and in range, she may then resolve any remaining hit locations from her attack."

          "When a monster's AI deck is greatly reduced, they can sometimes begin behaving a little strangely. This can be good or bad for the survivors, but either way it is intentional, and there is no need for any sort of rules intervention.<br><br>\n\nA couple examples: A White Lion with only Maul left in its deck will sniff every round if it doesn't find a target the first time it plays the card; A Butcher with only Kicks left in its AI deck will continue Kicking until all survivors are knocked down. If a survivor has the Priority Target token, it will Kick them until they die or figure out a way to get rid of it.<br><br>\n\nIf a White Lion with the Lost Hand Peristent Injury has only Vicious Claw left in its deck, the survivors may stand around gaining free understanding until they put the poor beast out of its misery."
